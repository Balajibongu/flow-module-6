## FLOW-Module6
## Crypto Poops
This Flow blockchain cadence program facilitates the generation of NFTs and incorporates essential functions such as deposit, borrow, withdraw, and more. These functions enable diverse financial transactions within the blockchain ecosystem.

## Overview
Designed for the Flow blockchain, this Cadence program operates as an intelligent contract. By executing various functions that modify the blockchain state through transactions, it not only allows for the creation of NFTs but also implements a range of interactions and adjustments. Presenting a straightforward structure, it offers efficient management of NFTs and their associated resources within the blockchain ecosystem.

## Running the Program
To execute this program, the Flow Playground, an online cadence IDE, can be utilized. The code compilation involves importing the non-fungible token standard into the main contract. Subsequently, a "borrowauthnft" function is created according to project requirements. An interface is established, incorporating specific functions to be publicly accessible. Finally, the transaction is deployed to retrieve and read the metadata stored within the NFT.
